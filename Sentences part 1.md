Linux bores me so much that I struggle to concentrate.   
&nbsp;
I cross my heart and hope to die  
&nbsp;
My mind goes blank  
&nbsp;
Whenever I attempt to converse in English, my mind turns completely blank.  
&nbsp;
I was never the standard student that everyone at school praised.   
&nbsp;
The part where she declared herself as a person who is willing to hide just to showcase the best in others.
