Linux bores me so much that I struggle to concentrate.

I cross my heart and hope to die

My mind goes blank

Whenever I attempt to converse in English, my mind turns completely blank.

I was never the standard student that everyone at school praised.

The part where she declared herself as a person who is willing to hide just to showcase the best in others.
